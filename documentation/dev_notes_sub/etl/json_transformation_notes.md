## date
date transformation (taking out the "//") Done by making it a string and slicing then transforming into a datetime var

## weaknesses, strengths, and tech scores
lists have been made separately for easy use in moving to the sql 



## Nix's section
all singular data has been transformed as is and saved to a separate data frame to be returned as it's own table


## general
each table has names and dates for linking and primary key use

to stop overriding of data (python defaults to pointers), use of the copy command has been implemented.
